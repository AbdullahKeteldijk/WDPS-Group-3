# Assignment 1: Large Scale Entity Linking
The goal of this assignment was to take an input containing WARC files and process this input. The processing should contain a NER part as well as an entity linking component.
We devided the assigments in three different steps:
## 1) Reading the WARC file from the HDFS

## 2) Parsing the HTML content to make it useable

## 3) Extract Named Entities from the text

## 4) Link entities to Freebase
