# Assignment 1: Large Scale Entity Linking
The first assignment for this course is to perform [Entity Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking) on a collection of web pages. Your solution should be scalable and accurate, and conform to the specifications below. You should work in groups of 3 or 4 people, and use a version control system that we can access. You can use any existing languages or tools you want, as long as it's easy for us to run it on the DAS-4 cluster. Of course, your solution is not allowed to call web services over the internet. You are encouraged to use the technologies covered in the lectures.

Your solution should be runnable trough a bash script with the command line options specified below. An example of some dummy starter code is available in this repository.
